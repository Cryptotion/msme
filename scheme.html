                </strong> 
                <p class="card-text">
                    ZED is a comprehensive initiative by the Indian government to promote quality manufacturing and eco-friendly processes among Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The certification encourages MSMEs to adopt best practices that ensure their products are of the highest quality
                    ("Zero Defect") while minimizing their impact on the environment ("Zero Effect"). It aligns with the vision of making India a global manufacturing hub by helping MSMEs achieve world-class standards in
                    production, sustainability, and competitiveness. <br> <br>

                    ZED Certification offers multiple benefits to MSMEs. Firstly, it enhances their market credibility, allowing them to compete on a global stage by meeting international quality standards. Secondly, the
                    certification enables MSMEs to optimize their processes, reduce wastage, and adopt energy-efficient methods, ultimately lowering operational costs. This also helps businesses transition to more sustainable, environmentally conscious operations, which is increasingly demanded by consumers and
                    global trade partners. <br><br>

                    Moreover, ZED-certified MSMEs enjoy various incentives such as easier access to credit, subsidies
                    for certification, and priority in government tenders. These benefits not only reduce financial constraints but also foster innovation and capacity building within the sector. MSMEs also receive
                    training and handholding support during the certification process, ensuring they can continually improve their operations and product quality. <br><br>

                    By obtaining ZED Certification, MSMEs can unlock new opportunities for growth, contribute to India’s economic progress, and play a pivotal role in achieving the nation’s vision of becoming a global
                    manufacturing leader. For businesses seeking long-term sustainability, competitiveness, and market leadership, ZED Certification is a powerful tool that fosters excellence and responsible growth.

                        <li>
                            Lean Manufacturing Techniques: MSMEs are guided in the implementation of techniques such as 5S, Kaizen, Value Stream Mapping, Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), and Just-in-Time (JIT). These techniques help in optimizing production processes, minimizing wastage, and improving operational efficiency.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>

                            Expert Guidance: Under the scheme, MSMEs receive technical and managerial support from qualified consultants who provide hands-on training and guidance. This includes assistance in identifying areas of improvement and executing lean methodologies.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>

                            Cluster Approach: MSMEs are organized into groups or clusters to facilitate collective learning and cost-sharing for implementing lean practices. This approach also fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing among MSMEs in similar sectors or regions.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>

                            Financial Support: The government provides financial assistance of up to 80% of the cost for lean manufacturing consultant fees, making it easier for MSMEs to adopt these practices without a significant financial burden.
